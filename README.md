# Loan-Approval-Prediction-ML
Loan approval prediction using Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting


# 🏦 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not
based on applicant details using machine learning classification models.

## 🎯 Objective
To build and compare Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
models for accurate loan approval prediction.

- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes applicant information such as:
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Loan Amount Term
- Credit History
- Gender, Education, Marital Status

## 🤖 Models Implemented
